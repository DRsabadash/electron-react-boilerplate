/*
  Define your reducer types here to be imported in the root reducer
  as well as your action creators. and bindStateToProps methods in
  your components. reducerTypes are used to create duplicate reducers
  with identical 'actions', but each having their own state.
  An example of this would be to have a unique storage reducer for each
  stateful component. Reducer types should follow a naming convention of
  ACTION_RESOURCE, i.e STORE_CREDENTIALS, or DELETE_DATA (storage reducer)
  or REQUEST_LOGIN | REQUEST_[some database resource] (network reducer)

//export const REQUEST_DATA = 'REQUEST_DATA';
